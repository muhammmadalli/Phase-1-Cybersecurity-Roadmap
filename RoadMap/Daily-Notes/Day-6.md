>[!tip] 
> - `su` stands for Superuser Do which runs the command as a superuser (or root user)
> - There are two types of a groups-- `the primary and the secondary groups`
> 	- User is part of a primary group but can be part of multiple secondary groups.
> 	- When you create a new user with `adduser`, it automatically creates a primary group for that user with the same name as the username. This is called a User Private Group (UPG) scheme.

- What needs review:

> [!Info] Understanding and Manipulating File Permissions and Ownership
> In this section we will learn about the use of the `chmod` command to change the permissions of the file to its respective `User , Group and Others`.
> ```bash
> 1. 7 (owner): Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
>2. 5 (group): Read (4) + Execute (1) = 5
>3. 0 (others): No permissions
>```
>This permission set means:
>
>- The owner (jack) can read, write, and execute the file
>- Members of the jack group can read and execute the file
>- Others have no permissions on the file
