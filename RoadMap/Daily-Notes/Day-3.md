# 📓 Day 3

**Focus: Bandit 7- 10** 
🔗 **Learning Links:**
- 🎮 [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
- [Piping and Redirection](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/piping.php)
## Tasks
- [x] Task 7 ✅ 2025-09-01
	- [x] The command `ls -l` is used to list all the files with the details including all that of owner, group and permissions etc. which can be seen in the tip. ✅ 2025-09-01
	- [x] `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null` using this command in which user bandit7 and group bandit 6 has access contains the password. ✅ 2025-09-01

- [x] Task 8 ✅ 2025-09-03
	- [x] Using `du -b <filename>` to tell the data in the form of bytes instead of blocks/kilobytes. ✅ 2025-09-03
	- [x] Using `grep millionth data.txt` command to look for the file that has word millionth in the file and see the password in that line for the next level. ✅ 2025-09-03
- [x] Task 9 ✅ 2025-09-03
	- [x] Using the `sort <filename>` command to sort the data in alphabetical order and then using the command `uniq -u` command to extract the data that is unique. ✅ 2025-09-05
	- [x] `sort <filename> | uniq -u` ✅ 2025-09-05
- [x] Task 10 ✅ 2025-09-05
	- [x] To read the data in human readable from we use the `strings <filename>` command to extract the strings data which is readable. ✅ 2025-09-11
	- [x] Use of the `grep '==='`command to find out the password next to the line containing `equal 2 signs`. ✅ 2025-09-11

>[!tip] Important
>This shows how the `ls -l` command works while listing all the directory and its files.

## Reflections
- What I learned today:
```bash
ls -l
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
du -b <filename>
grep <pattern> <filename>
sort <filename> | uniq -u
strings <filename> | grep ===
```

- What needs review:

>[!Abstract]
> The above mentioned link in the `Piping and Redirection` link mentioned above which you have to go through.
>
> - **STDIN (0):** Standard input (data fed into the program)  
> - **STDOUT (1):** Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal)  
> - **STDERR (2):** Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal)  
>
> ```bash
> Examples Saving to a File and Redirecting From a File
> 1. ls > output # "The greater than operator ( > ) indicates to the command line that we wish the programs output (or whatever it sends to STDOUT) to be saved in a file instead of printed to the screen"
> 2. wc -l <filename> > output # "Count the lines in the file and writes the new data in the `output` file "
> 3. ls >> output # "Using `>>` the new data is appended to the file instead of remvoving the previous data"
> 4. wc -l < <filename> # "If we use the less than operator ( < ) then we can send data the other way. We will read data from the file and feed it into the program via it's STDIN stream."
> 5. When we ran it redirecting the contents of the file into wc the file name was not printed. This is because whenever we use redirection or piping.As a result, this mechanism is often used in order to get `ancillary data` (which may not be required) to not be printed.

> Examples Redirecting STDERR
> 1. ls -l video.mpg blah.foo 2> errors.txt # "You know what this command is doing."
> 2. 1. ls -l video.mpg blah.foo > myoutput 2>&1 # "Saving both the output STDERR and STDOUT in the filenamed myouput."

> 
> ```bash
> Examples of Piping
> 1. ls | head -3 | tail -1  # "Using the Piping to pass the ouput to the next command"

>4. ls -l /etc | less # "`less` is a pager: it lets you scroll through text one screen at a time instead of dumping it all at once."
