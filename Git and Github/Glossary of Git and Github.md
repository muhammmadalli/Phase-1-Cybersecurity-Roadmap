## 📖 Glossary / Notes

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Branch** | A lightweight movable pointer to a commit; used for isolated development. |
| **Commit** | A snapshot of the repository at a point in time, identified by a SHA‑1 hash. |
| **Remote** | A version of the repository hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub). |
| **Fork** | A personal copy of someone else’s repository, usually on GitHub. |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | A request to merge changes from one branch (or fork) into another. |
| **Merge** | Integrating changes from one branch into another, creating a new commit that has two parents. |
| **Rebase** | Re‑applying commits on top of another base commit; rewrites history. |
| **Fast‑Forward** | A merge that can be resolved by simply moving the branch pointer forward. |
| **Rebase vs. Merge** | Rebase keeps history linear but rewrites commits; merge preserves history and adds a merge commit. |
| **.gitconfig** | Global configuration file for Git settings and aliases. |
| **.git/hooks** | Directory for executable scripts that run at specific Git events (e.g., pre‑commit). |
| **SSH Key** | Public/private key pair used for authenticating with GitHub without a password. |
| **gh CLI** | GitHub’s command‑line interface for interacting with GitHub APIs (create PRs, issues, etc.). |
| **Stash** | Temporarily saving uncommitted changes to return to later. |
| **Safecrlf** | A Git setting that prevents accidental line‑ending conversions when pushing or pulling. |
| **Signingkey** | Optional GPG key used to cryptographically sign commits. |
| **Alias** | Short command for a longer Git command (e.g., `lg` for `log --oneline`). |
